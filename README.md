1. Local Development Guideline:
- Apache Tomcat 9.1
- MySQL Server
Note: The local DB will use port 3306. If the port is being used, please change it to a different port or stop another program using this port.
In my program, it use the database with name as mydb (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/mydb)

What I have completed:
*** 2.1 Functionalities:
- Log in account
- Sign up account
- Create Tweet
*** 2.2 Technology Choices
- Front-end: HTML,CSS,...
- Back-end: Java
- Database: http://localhost/phpmyadmin

What can be improved:
- More unit tests for back-end
- Write sone end-to end tests
- Real-time sync for Tweet using socket.io
- The front-end can be build and deployed Google Store for faster performance
- We can create 1 more branch called releases. The CI should suport deploying the app when code is merged to this branch.
